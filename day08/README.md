# Happiness Analysis 2019 😊

This project analyzes global happiness data for the year 2019. Using a dataset of countries' happiness scores and related indicators, we explore patterns, correlations, and clusters to better understand factors contributing to happiness across the world.

## 📊 Dataset 

The dataset used is a CSV file containing information for multiple countries, including:

* `Country or region` – the country name
* `Score` – overall happiness score
* `GDP per capita` – economic output per person
* `Social support` – perceived social support
* `Healthy life expectancy` – expected healthy lifespan
* `Freedom to make life choices` – perceived freedom
* `Generosity` – charitable behaviors
* `Perceptions of corruption` – perception of corruption in government and business

The data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (or any other source you used).

## 🔨 Tools Used

* Python 3
* Pandas & Numpy – data manipulation and analysis
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization
* Scikit-learn – clustering analysis

## 📈 Analysis and Visualizations

1. **Top 10 Happiest Countries** 🏅

   * A bar chart showing the 10 countries with the highest happiness scores in 2019.

2. **GDP vs Happiness** 💰

   * Scatter plot showing the correlation between GDP per capita and happiness score.
   * Correlation coefficient is calculated to quantify the relationship.

3. **Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)** 🔥

   * Heatmap showing correlations between key features: Score, GDP, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, and Perceptions of corruption.

4. **Comparison between Europe and Asia** 🌍

   * Boxplot comparing happiness scores between selected European and Asian countries.

5. **Clustering of Countries** 🧮

   * KMeans clustering using multiple features to group countries with similar happiness profiles.
   * Scatter plot of GDP per capita vs Score colored by cluster.
