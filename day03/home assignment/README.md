I created a new folder inside Day03 of homework and copied the code I wrote last week "from_day02" into it. I created two new files
1. dilution_logic - the calculation of my dilution calculator
2. Gui_logic - the UI part of the code

For the tests, I asked ChatGPT to help me test my code in two ways using the pytest library. I also tested myself by manually calculating the tests that the chat gave and when I saw that they were correct, I made sure that I was indeed able to run them properly (I also used the chat to install pytest along the way).
I focused on testing the dilution_logic file only to make sure that the calculation I used in the code works correctly and returns the correct result and I got the expected result - ==
